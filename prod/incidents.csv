I'm 77 , starting as an engineer in local government. Working in the water industry 50 years designing managing and building water and wastewater assets. They were always liabilities until you could sell them (as they did). Road to disaster.

The big issue not in focus is the lack of public understanding. I agree that farm pollution is a major problem and utilities are guilty but there' much more. 
 
All the housing estates built in the last 50 years are separately sewered. We get washing machines in garages and blokes changing engine oil dumping the old oil in handily placed road gullies. All connected to surface water sewers feeding ino streams and rivers. People just don't realise or choose not to. I've told EA people they need a public awareness campaign. Its too much trouble even though it's easy! If you would like me to expand and help I'll be pleased to assist. 07713 845459",0,0,,,,
